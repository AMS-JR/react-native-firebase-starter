## How to create your own copy of this app?
### Prerequisites
To create an own copy of this application, you have some prerequisites. They are -

 - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) installed on your system.
 - Have the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and paths set properly.
 - An android emulator or real device to run the app.
 - A google account for having [Firebase Web](https://firebase.google.com) configuration.

### Make own copy
First clone the repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/jsappme/react-native-firebase-starter.git
    cd react-native-firebase-starter

Then install the dependencies using:

    yarn

To link the react-native-vector-icons package the to react native:

    react-native link

Then run the following command to run the app on the emulator.

    react-native run-android

or if you have Xcode installed:

    react-native run-ios

if you want to see the logs:

    react-native log-android

or

    react-native log-ios

Now, you have your own copy of this application!

## Credits
I barely created the application. I just created the front end shell and done some integration with firebase. All the credits goes to all library creators and contributors to those repositories and libraries. I'm really grateful to all of them.
